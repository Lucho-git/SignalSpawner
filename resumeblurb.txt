My software development summary:


I am a Software Engineering graduate from Curtin university, since leaving uni I developed a full stack web application Telebagger to buy and sell 
Cryptocurrencies based off of Telegram trading signals. As well as simulating potential trades.
The backend was developed with Python, and hosted using free webservices Heroku and Firebase.
The frontend was developed with HTML,CSS,Javascript, the Materialize framework and hosted with Netlify.

I am most proficient in Python, but can quickly adapt to any language or techstack.
